    "In this project, I will be working with data from a Twitter account known as @WeRateDogs. This data will be gathered in three ways. For the first dataset I will use a downloaded archive of their 2017 tweets that the account owners downloaded and sent to Udacity in an email, the second dataset is an image prediction file that Udacity provided as part of the project, and the third dataset will be acquired through the Twitter API.\n",
